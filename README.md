# Current State
If you followed this project previously, you might be aware there was a more GT5/GT6 verison of this mod in the works. However due to various other GT projects in progress - I would like to contribute those ideas elsewhere rather than constructing a mod like that from scratch myself. This project will remain a fun and easy going GT1 style addon for IC2C. Thanks for understanding.

# Issues
Please report any issues you find to the issue tracker on this repository. Include as much information as possible including as version and steps to reproduce.

# Contribution
Please do! Any and all ideas are welcome, although I am trying to keep this mod small and fun - I am still open to any suggestions.
Feel free to fork or clone this project and experiment with the code yourself while respecting the closed nature of the Ic2c source.
If you would like to run this project in a dev enviorment, you will need: JEI, IC2 Classic Dev, and Forestry.
